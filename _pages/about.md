I am now a Risk Quant at a French banking HK branch. This is my first full time job and I am sincerely appreciate the oppotunirty provided by my employer. I got a lot of supports from here and spent a very happy time. I improved a lot in my English spoken, pitch skill and learnt a comprehensive methodology to monitor whole risk, no matter credit, market, oprational or model risk. Also, we are close to the hot topic about ESG - climate risk management. As a girl just solely interact with the society, my company gives me not only good pay but also flexibility, sharing platform and best work environment. I love this friendly company, and I will always regard it as my family!
